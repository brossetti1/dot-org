								<h2>The Challenge</h2>
								<p>
									The first iteration of the Tellor Dispute Center functioned okay, but had its fair share of bugs, usability flaws, and was built in a way that made it hard to maintain and improve quickly. On the design side, there wasnâ€™t really a fleshed out style guide to work with, so some visual design would be necessary.

						<h2 className="IconHeader"><IconAxes /> Our Approach</h2>
						<p>
							We began the raid with a quick sprint to deeply understand the Tellor oracle system from a technical and brand level. With this understanding in place, we then ran simultaneous audits on the codebase and user experience. Through the process, we came up with many actionable directives to improve performance and usability of the Dispute Center and the Price Feed.
